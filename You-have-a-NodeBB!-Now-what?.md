Congratulations! You have a brand new NodeBB instance humming along, but what do you do next?

## Customise your categories
NodeBB ships with twelve categories set up, but you may want to edit these defaults and rename them to whatever you'd like to talk about.

When you set up your community, you were asked to set up an administrator name and password. You can log in now:

... and then access the administration panel by clicking this button:

From there, click on the "Categories" link at the left, and set up your categories the way you'd wish. You can alter titles, colours, and various other options here. You can also drag categories to re-order them.

## Build your community!

Now that you're done setting up your NodeBB, invite some users! Share the link to your friends and family, and let the discussions begin :)
