To enable post image attachments, first create an imgur app from :

https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient

You can use : "Anonymous usage without user authorization"

After that you will get a "Client ID". Paste this Client ID to the "Imgur Client ID" section in the admin/settings page. Save the settings and you should be able to upload images by dragging them into the composer window.
